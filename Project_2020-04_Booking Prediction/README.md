## Objective

A hotel business owner itâ€™s having difficulty staffing the appropiate amount of personnel due to special request in the hotel. Considering the amount of cancelations, somtimes the hotel is overstaff or understaffed.

By analysing the data, I found the number of booking cancelations could be predicted as a targeted dependent variable based on varity of independent variables e.g. the type of deposit, the distribution channel, the arrival month, and the number of adults...

Prediction model with certain confidence level was developed to predict the actual booking status, and thus help the owner decided the staffing status to save the operational cost.
