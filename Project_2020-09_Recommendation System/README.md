## Projects Review

### BackgroundInstacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. 

### Objective
The target is to create a system that will make a recommendation based on the last order and what is currently in a user’s cart. In order to achieve this goal, I have built a recommender system and tested five models to obtain the best result. Overall, the popular items model gave the best result apart from the item-based collaborative filtering model which would be the suggested recommender model. The reason for choosing IBCF over popular is that the IBCF is the best performing model that is tailored to each individual user’s cart.

### Achievement
An item-based recommendation system is built to provide numbers of items for customers to choose based on their shopping histories.
