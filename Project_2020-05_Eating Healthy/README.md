## Projects Review

### Background
A health and wellness company wants to help determine what eating and health habits are associated with being overweight, and to determine high-risk groups to target for a health campaign. Using a 2014 Health Dataset collected by the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s
Economic Research Service, I used logistic regression, and random forest, to predict the likelihood of being overweight based on eating patterns. 

### Objective
The goal is to help determine what eating and health habits are associated with being overweight, and to determine high-risk groups to target for a health campaign.

I used two models: logistic regression, and random forest, to predict the likelihood of being overweight based on eating patterns. The analysis shows that those who spend more time eating, who do not drink soda and do not eat meat are significantly less likely to be overweight. The random forest model provided more accurate predictions than the logistic model. 

### Achievement
A clustering model is used to locate groups with similar eating patterns in our data set and noted two distinct groups, with group 1 at higher risk of being overweight compared to group 2.
A Shiny App is deployed to provide visualization of the clustering and the prediction based on that.
