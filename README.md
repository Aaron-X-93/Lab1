## Projects Review

### 1 Hotel Bookings Analysis
[Hotel booking demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)

Objective: The goal is to predict the amount of special request the hotel will receive based on booking/special request historical data. the hotel would like to know the special requests it is likeley to receive, in order to know how much staff it will require.

Based on the data, the number of booking cancelations in a binary value (1) for no cancel and (0) for cancel. The analysis shows the type of deposit, the distribution channel, the arrival month, and the number of adults can help to predict the amount of special requests the hotel could receive. I use logistic regression model, decision tree model and random forest model to predict the cancellation probability for each booking. In this case, random forest model give the best result.


### 2 Eating Habits vs Overweight
[Eating & Health Module Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bls/eating-health-module-dataset)

Objective: The goal is to help determine what eating and health habits are associated with being overweight, and to determine high-risk groups to target for a health campaign.

I used two models: logistic regression, and random forest, to predict the likelihood of being overweight based on eating patterns. The analysis shows that those who spend more time eating, who do not drink soda and do not eat meat are significantly less likely to be overweight. The random forest model provided more accurate predictions than the logistic
model. A clustering model is used to locate groups with similar eating patterns in our data set and noted two distinct groups, with group 1 at higher risk of being overweight compared to group

I also made an app on the Shiny App platform so individuals can input their eating and health patterns to find out their likelihood of being or becoming overweight:
