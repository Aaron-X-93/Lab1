## Projects Review

### Background

Big Data and Analytics Conference organizers in Toronto want to conduct an analysis on topics related to AI that were relevant to local users for their inaugural event. We did sentiment analysis and word clustering for twitter data with certain key words covering the period from January 2020 to October 2020. 
### Objective

When hosting an event, attracting sponsors, vendors and attendees is central to the event’s success. Therefore, the organizers want to ensure there is a market for their event in their chosen location. Their main business objective is to see how it will be received in the local community. Another important goal was to perform a sentiment analysis, find topic themes to help build the agenda, draw attendees, assist with marketing efforts, and select the keynote speakers. We obtained tweets on the topic of AI from Twitter to find out if the sentiment is related to smarter and responsible AI. We were able to extract a dataset using search terms related to AI.

### Achievement
Based on the text analysis of twitter data, we recommend using the themes of “global goals” and “ethics” as central topics to market and promote the event as well as increase revenue and help make future events successful.
