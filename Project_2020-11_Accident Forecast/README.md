## Projects Review

### Background
US-Accidents dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to June 2020 for the Contiguous United States. We use this to do research on forecasting the accident of the US and each state.

### Objective
The main objective is to analyze US accident data over the last few years for trends. A forecast model is developed for the next ten years by state and an aggregate forecast for the US.  ARIMA algorithm is used to create the forecasts at the national level and by state. 
The results show that there is an overall increase in accidents in the United States as a country and the majority of the individual states show an increase as well.

### Achievement
Forecasts of yearly accident trends for US and each state.
